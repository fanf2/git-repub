The 'git repub' command maintains a "repub branch" that you can use to
record the history of another "rebasing branch" that is repeatedly
rewound. Updates to the repub branch are fast-forwards, so they are
convenient to publish.

It performs a similar function to `stg publish`, though the structure
of a repub branch is rather different from a StGit public branch. A
repub branch can be thought of as tracking the head of the rebasing
branch in a similar way to its reflog, except it is updated manually
and it is shareable.
