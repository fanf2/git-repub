git-repub(1)
=============

NAME
----
git-repub - Make rebasing branches and their history publishable

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git repub' [options] [--from <branch>] [--onto <branch>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The 'git repub' command maintains a branch that you can use to record
the history of another branch that is repeatedly rebased. Updates to
the history branch are fast-forwards, so they are convenient to
publish.

The --from branch is the rebasing branch and the --onto branch is the
history publication branch onto which 'git repub' will add another
commit. If one of --from or --onto is missing, the other defaults to
the current branch. If both are missing, the current branch's config
is checked to find its corresponding repub-from or repub-onto branch.

The commits on a repub-onto branch are merges, where the first parent
is the previous head of the repub-onto branch and the second parent is
the head of the repub-from branch. The tree resulting from the merge
is always the same as the tree at the head of the repub-from branch -
the previous contents of the repub-onto branch are ignored. Because
this is a somewhat heavy-handed operation, and to protect against
mistakes, by default 'git repub' checks that the head of the
repub-onto branch matches this structure.

OPTIONS
-------
--from <branch>::
	The rebasing branch whose head is to be published. If the
	--from option is not given and --onto is given, the --from
	<branch> defaults to the current branch.

--onto <branch>::
	The history-preserving publication branch on which a merge
	commit will be constructed. If the --onto option is not given
	and --from is given, the --onto <branch> defaults to the
	current branch.

--dry-run::
	Do not make any commits, but report what would happen.

--init::
	Short for --config --start.

--config::
	Record the --from and --onto options in the repository's
	configuration as well as making the merge commit. (See
	CONFIGURATION below.)

--config-only::
	Just record the configuration and do not make the merge
	commit. Equivalent to --config --dry-run.

--start::
	Create the --onto branch. Two commits will be created
	immediately: the first commit will be empty and the second
	commit will be a 'git repub' merge.

--force::
	Do not check that the head of the --onto branch is a 'git
	repub' merge.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

branch.<branch>.repub-onto::
	Indicates the <branch> is a repub-from branch, and the
	corresponding repub-onto branch is the value of this config
	setting.

branch.<branch>.repub-from::
	Indicates the <branch> is a repub-onto branch, and the
	corresponding repub-from branch is the value of this config
	setting.
